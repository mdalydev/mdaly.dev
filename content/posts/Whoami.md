description: Brief introduction to myself + the blog
---
Hello reader, I'm going to quickly introduce myself and the purpose of the blog. 

My name is Markham and I recently graduated with a BS in Cybersecurity. I am excited to build my career and share my personal projects here!

This blog mainly exists as a record of my projects, including what they are, details, and how I think. These projects are a way for me to learn about new technology so I can grow.

Tone will mix between professional and casual. My goal is to be detailed and technical enough without being too generic. I want anyone, regardless of their IT background to be able to learn from my posts, without losing its technical value. 

Going forward I will be exploring multiple different projects. Most of them will stem from a home lab I am currently working on building. 

Thank you for reading and I look forward to making more posts soon.
